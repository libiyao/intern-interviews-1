        <p>
            My name is Biyao Li and I'm currently a senior at the University of Washington studying applied and computational mathematics.
            During the last summer, I was a part of a start up that was founded by my friend where I helped them to develop a website using
            React. It was a great learning experience for me because it allows me to enhance me coding skills and become more competent in terms
            of software developing. I'm really interested in software developing because it gives me an opportunity to development a software that
            could make a gigantic impact on other people's life. Like how LOB designs products that help the customers to send emails more efficiently 
            and at a large scale, I want to be able to design innovative products that can solve real world problems and make our daily life more
            productive. I think I can achieve this by having a more professional software developing experiences which can give me an opportunity
            to learn how to make better design choices and provide a good customer experience.
